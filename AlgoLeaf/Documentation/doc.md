# Modelisation of Leaves Venation patterns

## L-System

L-System is not really adapted to the concept of leaves venation pattern. With L-System 
you can only modelise realistic venation of degree 1 or 2 but not higher

Example of leaf, generated with L-System:

However, L-System is very usefull for generating realistic leaf shapes.
